This file lists my notes attempting to find PDE equation solvers... I didn't end up using any of them.

# TODO: model PDEs, solve with equation solver?
# (34) simplified set of linear eqns from (27). Also (35) is compact version of (34) if needed...
# From section VI: "techniques for estimating and fitting these parameters on real data is later detailed in Section VI."

[Parameter fitting methods]: section VI
Method 1: constrained-weighted-LS:
- error func: (52)
- model params: θ(t) ** to be estimated
- (53) 
θˆ = argmin trE[e(t)We(t)T]
        θ
- SOLUTION: ". This problem is in the form
of nonlinear CWLS for which a variety of stable numerical
solvers exist. Refer to [31] for a survey of methods and [32,
Ch. 5] for methods specific to dynamic systems."

Method 2: Extended Kalman Filter
- See Appendix B for steps
- "An implementation of the EKF for epidemic model parameter
and state vector tracking will be provided online in the Git
repository of the project" -- link: ____

# NOTE: Set initial conditions where needed. Also, use identity matrix if needed.
